# Azure Resources mind maps 

While preparing for AZ 103 exam I gathered information from online courses like Skyline, LinuxAcadamy and other internet resources. I find that mind maps are a quick way of browsing high level view of the topic or finding for a sub-level topic. Once the hierarchy is established in the mind one can always drill down and research the topics. Below are few mind maps that I am building right now and they are in DRAFT version and may get updated over time or as I learn more.

If anyone find a mistake please raise an issue and I will try to fix it ASAP to the best of my ability.
